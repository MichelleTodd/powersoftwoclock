# Powers of Two Clock
A [helpful clock](http://michelletodd.github.io/powersoftwoclock/) for
memorizing large powers of two. Just kidding. It just makes you look cool.

# Printing Times
Some times are better than other times because they make powers of two!

Other times we can find a power of two that's relatively small, especially if
you've spent a few hours of your life learning the powers of two up to 50 (not
that anyone does that definitely not of course not).

Sometimes we can't.

And yes, the powers are calculated on the fly instead of [insert alternate
method here] because it's more fun that way!
